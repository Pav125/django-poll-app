'''Note that the name of the matched pattern in the path strings of the second and third patterns 
has changed from <question_id> to <pk>. This is necessary because weâ€™ll use the DetailView 
generic view to replace our detail() and results() views, and it expects the primary key value 
captured from the URL to be called "pk".'''
